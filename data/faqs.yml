- q: My simulated display is too big/too small - how do I change the resolution it is operating at?
  a: |
    * [Windows 10](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/change-screen-resolution-windows-10-2)
    * [Windows 8/7/Vista/XP](http://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-Screen-Resolution-on-a-PC)
    * [Linux](http://www.perpetualpc.net/srtd_resolution.html) (command line)
    * [OSX](http://osxdaily.com/2015/08/27/show-all-display-resolutions-external-screen-mac/)
    * [OSX utility Display Menu](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/display-menu/id549083868?mt=12) makes changing resolutions easy


- q: What resolutions/refresh rates are encoded in the Headless Ghost/NewerTech Headless - does it do 4K/2K/1080p etc?
  a: |

    * 2048x1536 30Hz/29Hz
    * 1920x1440 75Hz/60Hz
    * 1920x1200 90Hz/75Hz/60Hz
    * 1920x1080 120hz/100Hz/90Hz/75Hz/60Hz/30Hz

    * 640x480 100Hz/75Hz/60Hz/30Hz

    A full report of available modes can be found [here](https://headlessghost.com/res/Docs/NewerTech_headlessModule_EDIDReport_Public.pdf)


- q: I want to use a mode that isn't in the list - can I add my own display modes?
  a: |
    Yes! It is possible to set up custom display modes. These links are provided for information only and are not supported by Headless Ghost. Making use of these techniques is done at your own risk.

    * Windows users can make changes in software using the [Custom Resolution Utility](http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU)
    * Linux users can re-write the EDID inside the module using [edid-rw](https://github.com/bulletmark/edid-rw)
    * Windows users can re-write the EDID inside the module using [PowerStrip](http://entechtaiwan.com/util/ps.shtm)
    * Information on accessing and programming the EDID directly via the hardware can be found here [https://headlessghost.com/res/Docs/ProgrammingInformation_HeadlessGhost.zip]
